# 02.137 DH Introduction to Digital Humanities

### Final Project

Hey there! If you are reading this, then it must mean that you have seen our poster. In this module we were
tasked to use our scholarship of the humanities and computation skills to create a meaningful research in the
field of humanities. Hence, my group decided to research on the topic of box office hits. Specifically what 
made films special enough to be put in top-earning list. So we decided to find the answers by utilising frames
of the respective movie trailers.


For this project we analysed a list of films labelled as highest grossing movies 
worldwide by Box Office Mojo all the way from 1977 to 2019.

We then extracted 12 frames from each trailer and processed them through a software application to find
out values for mean brightness and hue. After they were found we mapped those values into plots and graphs in
chronological order. 

#### The visuals that can be in this repository are as follows:

1. Brightness plot of movie frames from 1977-1998 (derived using Imageplot)
2. Brightness plot of movie frames from 1999-2019 (derived using Imageplot)
3. Bar chart version of Average Brightness from over the years
4. Bar chart version of Average Hue from over the years
5. A combined plot of the first 2 visuals but with stills represented as white dots
